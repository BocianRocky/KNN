# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Algorithm

The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm implemented in Java serves the purpose of classification and regression tasks. 
It is a versatile and adaptive machine learning technique that analyzes the similarity between new data samples and existing ones in the training set. 
Based on this analysis, it assigns new data to appropriate classes or predicts numerical values.

Usage:
   1. Compilation: Compile the Java files.
   2. Execution: Run the Main.java file to execute the program.
   3. Input: Select the desired dataset and provide input parameters as required.
   4. Output: The program will classify the data or predict numerical values based on the k-NN algorithm.
Notes:
   - Optimize the choice of the parameter k (number of nearest neighbors) for better performance, using techniques like cross-validation.
